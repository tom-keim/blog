		Hi There! My name is Tom Keim and Iâ€™m a data engineer and enthousiast at <a href="http://infosupport.com">Info Support</a>. I mostly work at data projects with technologies like Microsoft Fabric, Microsoft SQL Server, Power BI, Databricks, Azure Data Factory and most other Azure data products.

		In my free time I like to spend time with my wife and two kids. Also I like to watch a lot of TV Shows & Movies or spent time on home automation with products like Home Assistant and ESPHome.
